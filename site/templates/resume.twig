        <p>
          Mastin Labs is a CMS/E-commerce platform built on Wordpress. Conversion rates and a highly polished front end were both very important to them, and we spent a lot of time getting the details right.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Modernized their front-end to use React and Redux.</li>
          <li>Modernized their back-end to use a modern PHP stack with package management.</li>
          <li>I developed automated installers for their photography software which works with both Windows and macOS. This drastically cut their need for support.</li>
          <li>After several crashes caused by high traffic, I moved their infrastructure to AWS to be more easily scalable. We haven't had the site buckle under load since.</li>
          <li>I improved page load times by over 25%, with tweaks and optimizations to all layers from database to application to networking and CDN's.</li>
          <li>I restructured their site to use Ansible for server provisioning and deployments, which has made our process much less error prone, and has helped provision new servers in minutes instead of hours.</li>

        <p>
          Plug is a client app for&nbsp;<a href="https://hypem.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hype Machine</a>, a popular music streaming and discovery service. It was a collaboration, with the very talented designer&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/glennui" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Glenn Hitchcock</a>, that we worked on in our spare time.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>I taught myself Objective-C and used it to develop v1 in 2012.</li>
          <li>In 2014, after Swift was released, I learned Swift and we decided to completely redesign and rewrite Plug for v2.</li>
          <li>Implemented crash reporting and got to 99.9% crash free sessions.</li>
          <li>Built up to about 4.5k monthly active users.</li>
          <li>We got an offer to purchase Plug from the owners of Hype Machine.</li>
          <li>We wanted to track Hype Machine track popularity over time, but Hype Machine did not offer this information through their API, so I used AWS Lambda serverless functions to track their top 50 songs over time for nearly 0 cost to us.</li>

          LDS is an inventory management system for dental offices.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>I built a Rails app from the ground up to efficiently track half a million pieces of inventory.</li>
          <li>I had to figure out a system that could print barcodes from specialized printers and then use wireless barcode scanners to enter items into inventory through the Rails web app, which was fairly complex.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Developed a highly documented and tested Rails API from scratch that interfaced with their Android app and SPA React web app. Included a lot of communication and team work to set specs that worked for the variety of use cases.</li>
          <li>Helped implement their SPA React web app, which was a complex graphical representation of their tile presentations.</li>
          <li>I pushed to implement an early version of Redux, which greatly simplified their state management.</li>
